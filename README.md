# My Web Project

This is a simple web project demonstrating the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that structures the content of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the web page.
